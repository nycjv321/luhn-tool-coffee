Luhn Tool
=========

Luhn Tool validates identification numbers using the Luhn algorithm (also known as the mod 10 algorithm).

Currently, it supports:

  - Validating existing account numbers
  - Generating the check digit of an account number
  - Calculating the Luhn checksum

I wrote this tool out of curiousity. Its not written for efficiency, instead the code is written to be human readible. Please forgive me for that. See [Wikipedia] for more information.
